Studying to become a programmer at the
university begins with the first year, where students study
the basics of computer science, programming languages and mathematical
logic. In lectures, they get acquainted with the basic concepts and principles of
working with data, and in practical classes consolidate their knowledge by performing
various tasks and projects.
